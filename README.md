> Generic h(e)lp(ers)

This is a sort of half-fork of the absolutely awesome [samber/lo](https://github.com/samber/lo). My only issue was the
lack of "error" variants in the slices helpers, even though lots of issues/PRs seem to have been raised to introduce
them.

For a complete list of included functions, see the [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nicjohnson145/hlp).
